# Clean Architecture & TDD with Flutter

[![Flutter basics](https://github.com/RazvanRauta/clean_architecture_flutter/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/RazvanRauta/clean_architecture_flutter/actions/workflows/main.yml)

Keeping your code clean and tested are the two most important development practices. 
In Flutter, this is even more true than with other frameworks. On one hand, it's nice 
to hack a quick app together, on the other hand, larger projects start falling apart 
when you mix the business logic everywhere. Even state management patterns like BLoC 
are not sufficient in themselves to allow for easily extendable codebase.

This is where we can employ clean architecture and test driven development. As 
proposed by our friendly Uncle Bob, we should all strive to separate code into 
independent layers and depend on abstractions instead of concrete implementations.
